Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the process of collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set for analysis.

Introduction
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Here are the data for project: (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

This Project contains:
Tidy Dataset
Codebook.md
README.md
R Script
The R Script does the following:
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
